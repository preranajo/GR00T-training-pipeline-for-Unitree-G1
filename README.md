# GR00T-training-pipeline-for-Unitree-G1
This repository contains ongoing work on fine-tuning the GR00T N1.5 model to automate a custom manipulation task using the Unitree G1 humanoid robot. The project focuses on setting up a custom task scene, collecting task-specific demonstrations, fine-tuning GR00T and deploying model checkpoints in simulation and the real robot.
